# Animal Crossing: Advance
Animal Crossing: Advance is a recreation of Animal Crossing: Population Growing for the Game Boy Advance. Due to graphics and size limitations, and the fact that the GameCube runs at 435Mhz with loads of ram and processing units, compared to the 16.78Mhz GameBoy Advance, it won't look as good, neither will it have 3D graphics or... 236 villagers (it will most likely have <100 of fan favorites from Animal Crossing GameCube), but it will function as a portable Animal Crossing game on the GBA, so that's that.

## Engine
I'm using the [BPCore Engine](https://github.com/evanbowman/BPCore-Engine) for the main game engine, which allows you to program GBA games using Lua compared to C or C++, neither of which I am familiar with, which makes it easier on me. If you are contributing, please make sure you have all the requirements on the BPCore Engine page.

## Progress
- As of 6/10/2022, I just started, so this GitHub page will have more to offer soon!
